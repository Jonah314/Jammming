# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) (or [oxc](https://oxc.rs) when used in [rolldown-vite](https://vite.dev/guide/rolldown)) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## React Compiler

The React Compiler is not enabled on this template because of its impact on dev & build performances. To add it, see [this documentation](https://react.dev/learn/react-compiler/installation).

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.

# JAMMMING
In this project, you will build a React web application called Jammming. You will use your knowledge of React components, passing state, and requests with the Spotify API to build a website that allows users to search the Spotify library, create a custom playlist, then save it to their Spotify account.

## Example Project
A preview of the Jammming project. A user looks up the name of an artist and adds songs fetched from the Spotify API to a playlist in the Jammming app.

## Project Requirements
- Build a web app using React
- Version control your application with Git and host the repository on GitHub
- Integrate with Spotify or another API
- Deploy your application
- Write a README (using Markdown) that documents your project, including:
--The purpose of your project
--Technologies used
--Features
--Future work

## Features:
- Users can search for songs by song title.
- You can also include functionality to search by other attributes like artist’s name, genre, etc.
- Users can see information about each song like title, artist, and album for songs they queried
- You can also include other information – the design is up to you
- Users can export their custom playlist to their personal Spotify account

## Prerequisites:
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- React
- HTTP Requests and Responses
- Authentication
